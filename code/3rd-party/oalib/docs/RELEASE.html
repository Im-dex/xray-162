<H1><A NAME="V1.0-2_-_APRIL_17,_2009"><A NAME="1">v1.0-2 - April 17, 2009

</A></A></H1>
<P>
All changes are relatively minor.  Completely backward compatible to v0.6. 
Added examples on how to create basic Open Automate proxy executables.


</P>

<H1><A NAME="V1.0_-_APRIL_9,_2009"><A NAME="2">v1.0 - April 9, 2009

</A></A></H1>
<P>
This is the first public release of the OpenAutomate SDK.  It is completely 
backward compatible with v0.6.  All changes are relatively minor.


</P>
<UL>
<LI>
Version number incremented to v1.0-1

</LI>
<P>
The version number has been incremented to 1.0-1, but backward compatibility
is maintained.  In the future, major version number changes (e.g. v2.0) will 
mean backward compatibility is not maintained.


</P>
<LI>
Many new tests were added to the conformance test suite

</LI>
<P>
We found a variety of cases where the test suite in v0.6 didn't catch 
conformance problems.  A variety of new tests have been added to ensure
these issues are found early by the application developer.


</P>
<LI>
License has been changed

</LI>
<P>
The license has been changed, now that OpenAutomate is public.  The new license
was written with the idea that all developers--commercial or open source--can
feel free to integrate OpenAutomate into their applications freely, without 
being encumbered by any licensing issues related to redistribution.


</P>
<P>
Please see the <B>LICENSE</B> file included with the SDK for more information.


</P>
<LI>
Added more command-line options to oatest

</LI>
<P>
oatest has a new command-line options for listing available test modules, and
choosing which specific modules should run.  Run oatest with the -h option
for a complete list of options.


</P>
</UL>

<H1><A NAME="V0.6_-_JULY_19,_2008"><A NAME="3">v0.6 - July 19, 2008

</A></A></H1>
<P>
This release helps maintain backward compatibility in future releases by
adding the byte size of structs passed to functions in the API to the 
structs themselves.  Unfortunately, this addition breaks backward compatibility
with previous versions of the OpenAutomate SDK.


</P>
<UL>
<LI>
Conformance test suite has been added

</LI>
<P>
The SDK now includes the OpenAutomate conformance test suite named <B>oatest</B> in
source form.  Applications that claim to be OpenAutomate compatible must pass
the tests within this suite.  Please see <A TARGET="_top" HREF="oatest.html">the <I>"oatest"</I> document</A> for more information.


</P>
<LI>
structs now have <B>StructSize</B> field

</LI>
<P>
<B>oaMessage</B>, <B>oaNamedOption</B>, <B>oaOptionDependency</B>,
and <B>oaCommand</B> now have a field <B>oaInt StructSize</B> as their first
field.  This is initialized to the <B>sizeof()</B> of their respective types
in order to allow either backward compatibility in future versions of the SDK
or graceful failure.


</P>
<P>
The <B>StructSize</B> field must be initialized by the associated <B>oaInitXXX()</B> 
functions:  


</P>
<PRE>    /* Initializes an oaMessage */
    void oaInitMessage(oaMessage *message);

    /* Initializes an oaCommand */
    void oaInitCommand(oaCommand *command);

    /* Initializes an oaNamedOption, and the member oaOptionDependency */
    void oaInitOption(oaNamedOption *option);
</PRE><LI>
<B>oaInitCommand()</B> added

</LI>
<P>
<B>oaInitCommand()</B> was added to the API.  It must be called on the <B>oaCommand</B>
object sent to <B>oaGetNextCommand()</B> before each call to <B>oaGetNextCommand()</B>.


</P>
<LI>
<B>ComparisonValType</B> member added to <B>oaOptionDependency</B> struct

</LI>
<P>
Until this release, plug-ins had to infer the type of 
<B>oaOptionDependency.ComparisonVal</B>
by maintaining a mapping of option names to option type from previous calls
to <B>oaAddOption</B>.  This had two unfortunate side-effects:


</P>
<UL>
<LI>
The application was required to always call <B>oaAddOption()</B>
for the parent option first.

</LI>
<LI>
Plug-ins had to maintain global state for the mapping, needlessly complicating plug-in development.

</LI>
</UL>
<P>
The addition of <B>ComparisonValType</B> removes these restrictions.  The 
application must now set this value to the type of the parent option.  
It must match the type of the parent option, when <B>oaAddOption</B> 
is called with it.


</P>
<LI>
added <B>oaiInitFuncTable()</B> in OpenAutomate_Internal.h

</LI>
<P>
This function should be used to initialize an <B>oaiFunctionTable</B> instead
of explicitly calling <B>memset()</B> and setting the <B>TableSize</B> field.


</P>
<P>
Note: This function is only used when developing OA plug-ins.


</P>
<LI>
Switched to <B>const oaChar *</B> from <B>oaString</B>

</LI>
<P>
Many locations where <B>oaString</B> were used have now been switched to
<B>const oaChar *</B> to force compile time restrictions in cases where the
string should not be modified. 


</P>
</UL>

<H1><A NAME="V0.5_-_JUNE_17,_2008"><A NAME="4">v0.5 - June 17, 2008

</A></A></H1>
<P>
Fifth alpha release.
This is mostly "service pack" release intended to ease OA integration


</P>
<UL>
<LI>
absolute paths were replaced with relative "../inc/file.h"-style paths

</LI>
<P>
It eliminates the need to change project options or change OpenAutomate sources


</P>
<LI>
Default level compile warnings were eiminated

</LI>
<P>
OpenAutomate should compile without warnings when default warning
level is used. 


</P>
<LI>
OpenAutomateUtil moved to examples

</LI>
<P>
It was decided OpenAutomateUtil is not essential part of the core OpenAutomate and may be separated
from the core OpenAutomate logic.


</P>
<LI>
simple_app.cpp was corrected and extended

</LI>
<P>
simple_app.cpp now enumerates options using namespaces
new options added to provide more relevant examples of options usage


</P>
<LI>
minor OpenAutomate core changes

</LI>
<PRE>  OpenAutomate.h:
    - OA_PLATFORM (old PLATFORM may cause collisions) is "autodetected"
  OpenAutomate.cpp: 
    - init string parsing modifications
    - Unicode fix (LoadLibraryA is replaced with LoadLibraryW)
    - minor bugfixes
</PRE></UL>

<H1><A NAME="V0.4_-_MAY_16,_2008"><A NAME="5">v0.4 - May 16, 2008

</A></A></H1>
<P>
Fourth alpha release.


</P>
<UL>
<LI>
all strings are assumed to be UTF-8

</LI>
<P>
From the docs:


</P>
<PRE>   All of the OpenAutomate functions that receive or return strings are assumed
   to be UTF-8 encoded strings.  This simplifies plug-in development, while still
   supporting all languages.  Furthermore, it maintains compatibility with 
   standard ASCII strings without any extra effort.
</PRE><LI>
added <B>oaAddFrameValue()</B> function 

</LI>
<P>
This function may be used for providing per frame statistics and results
during benchmark runs.  It works similarly to <B>oaAddResultValue()</B> but
is called every frame, before <B>oaDisplayFrame()</B> is called.


</P>
<LI>
more clearly defined <B>OA_CMD_RUN</B>

</LI>
<P>
From the docs:


</P>
<PRE>    This command instructs the application to run as normal; it should run as if
    OpenAutomate mode was never invoked.  However, when the user chooses to exit
    the application, the application must not exit the process.  Instead, it 
    should cleanup and return back to the command loop, calling 
    B<oaGetNextCommand()>.
</PRE><LI>
added oaSendSignal()

</LI>
<P>
This is a general mechanism for the application to signal the plug-in with various
events.  Currently, the only supported signal is for rebooting the system in the
middle of a benchmark run.  See the documentation for more information.


</P>
<LI>
added section on registering an OpenAutomate application within the system

</LI>
<P>
All OpenAutomate compatible apps are required to register themselves within 
the system during installation, in order to allow for quick identification of the
applications existence.


</P>
<P>
See <A TARGET="_top" HREF="README.html#REGISTERING_AN_APPLICATION_WITH_OPENAUTOMATE">the <I>"Registering an Application with OpenAutomate"</I> section of the <I>"README"</I> document</A> for more information>.


</P>
<P>
Also, see <B>OpenAutomateUtil.h</B> and <B>OpenAutomateUtil.c</B> for functions on 
registering, unregistering, and finding OpenAutomate enabled applications.


</P>
<P>
<I>Note: The Win32 registry is not supported by the utility functions in this 
release.</I>


</P>
<LI>
Added <B>OpenAutomateUtil.h</B> and <B>OpenAutomateUtil.c</B> 

</LI>
<P>
In addition, <B>OpenAutomateUtil.h</B> and <B>OpenAutomateUtil.c</B> were added to the
SDK.  These files are not strictly required for OpenAutomate compatibility, but 
are made available to users of the SDK to use as they see fit.


</P>
<P>
Currently, it the only functions included are ones related to application
registration.  


</P>
<LI>
added option namespaces

</LI>
<P>
Options can now be enumerated by the application in a hierarchical fashion 
similar to files and directories.  


</P>
<P>
The special namespace <B>User/</B> must be used to differentiate between options 
directly visible to the end-user, and ones that aren't.  
See <A TARGET="_top" HREF="README.html#REGISTERING_AN_APPLICATION_WITH_OPENAUTOMATE">the <I>"Registering an Application with OpenAutomate"</I> section of the <I>"README"</I> document</A> for more 
information.

<H1><A NAME="V0.3_-_MARCH_26,_2008"><A NAME="6">v0.3 - March 26, 2008

</A></A></H1>
<P>
Third alpha release.


</P>
<UL>
<LI>
Renamed SASH to OpenAutomate

</LI>
<P>
<B>OpenAutomate</B> is now the official name for the harness.  


</P>
<P>
All function and type prefixes are changed from <B>sash</B> to <B>oa</B>.  


</P>
<P>
Enum value prefixes are changed from <B>SASH_</B> to <OA_>.  


</P>
<P>
The <B>-sash</B> command-line option is now <B>-openautomate</B>.


</P>
<P>
All other references to <B>SASH</B> are changed to <B>OpenAutomate</B>.


</P>
</UL>

<H1><A NAME="V0.2_-_MARCH_9,_2008"><A NAME="7">v0.2 - March 9, 2008

</A></A></H1>
<P>
Second alpha release.


</P>
<UL>
<LI>
added <B>sashAddResultValue()</B>

</LI>
<P>
Can optionally be called at the end of a benchmark run, to communicate result
values such as benchmark scores, tests passing/failing, etc...


</P>
<LI>
added type parameter to <B>sashAddOptionValue()</B> 

</LI>
<P>
The prototype for <B>sashAddOptionValue()</B> has changed from: 


</P>
<PRE>   void sashAddOptionValue(const SASH_CHAR *name, const sashValue *value);
</PRE><P>
to: 


</P>
<PRE>   void sashAddOptionValue(const SASH_CHAR *name, 
                           sashOptionDataType value_type,
                           const sashValue *value);
</PRE><LI>
now backward compatible with older plug-ins

</LI>
<P>
Previously, addition of new functions to the SASH API required recompilation
of plug-ins to be compatible with apps that use the new API.  This is no 
longer necessary.


</P>
<P>
This matches the new <B>sashAddResultValue()</B>.  Previously, the type of the
value parameter was implicitely defined by the application through the
<B>SASH_CMD_GET_ALL_OPTIONS</B> command.  The requirement to issue this command
first is no longer needed.  Furthermore, the conformance test can now check
for consistency between the types in <B>SASH_CMD_GET_ALL_OPTIONS</B> and 
<B>SASH_GET_CURRENT_OPTIONS</B>.


</P>
<LI>
now portable to POSIX compatible OSs

</LI>
<P>
Can now be built on POSIX compatible OSs (e.g. Linux, Cygwin, ...).  note 
hasn't be tested extensively, and unicode support is not robust yet.


</P>
<P>
A GNUmakefile has been added, for building on these OSs.


</P>
