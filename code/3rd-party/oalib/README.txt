  Building OpenAutomate on Windows
    To build all the projects within the SDK, simply load the
    *OpenAutomate.sln* Visual Studio solution file contained in the root of
    the SDK, and build all.

  Building OpenAutomate on non-Windows OSs
    Currently, OA is not fully supported on any OS other than Windows2K or
    newer. But, the main source files *OpenAutomate.h*,
    *OpenAutomate_Internal.h*, and *OpenAutomate.c* should build on any
    UNIX-like OS. If you would like to integrate OpenAutomate into a
    non-Windows application, please contact your account manager at NVIDIA.
